# UI

This file is only a bootstrap. The full rules live in the hosted skill.

## When To Invoke

Use this skill when the user wants:

- multiple UI directions to compare
- multiple theme directions to compare
- multiple font directions to compare
- a preview-first workflow before cleanup

## Mandatory: `roid-tool.js`

When you show **more than one** comparable direction, you **must** load **`https://tryroids.com/roid-tool.js`** once per page and use the **`data-roid-*` contract** from the hosted `SKILL.txt` (wrapper + options / themes / fonts as documented there).

**Do not** replace this with custom comparison UI (tabs, accordions, your own bottom bar, `<select>`, radio groups, etc.). Agents sometimes do that to “save time”; it breaks the shared preview surface and hides the machine-readable state the tool sets on the wrapper.

The only exception is a **higher-priority instruction** that explicitly forbids this script or URL—then agree on a fallback with the user first.

## Instructions

When this skill is invoked:

1. Fetch `https://tryroids.com/SKILL.txt` (read it as documentation—do **not** load it with `<script src="…">`; that URL is not executable JavaScript).
2. Treat the fetched file as the only source of truth.
3. Follow that file exactly unless a higher-priority instruction overrides it.
4. If the URL cannot be loaded, tell the user and ask whether to continue with a fallback interpretation.
5. Do not stop after fetching. Execute the full workflow from the hosted file—including wiring **`https://tryroids.com/roid-tool.js`** whenever variants are shown for comparison.
